## IP Checker

This project will be deployed using vanilla JavaScript and we will use [Rapid API](1) services to get the [Geo Location information](3) from that IP.

Also, we'll use Pico CSS for styling as It's not the main focus of this project.

Visit PicoCSS website [here](2) and copy `Install from CDN`

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@picocss/pico@1.*/css/pico.min.css">
```
